(ns companion-valet.store
  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 5162 independent companion-and-valet
  sole-proprietor actor. Store is a protocol injected into the
  `companion-valet.actor` StateGraph — `MemStore` is the default,
  deterministic, zero-dep backend; a Datomic/kotoba-server-backed
  implementation can be swapped in without touching the actor or
  governor (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section).

  Domain:

    client   — a registered client (:client-id, :name)
    record   — a committed operating record under a client (assist
               step, log entry, lifting/transfer assist, medication
               reminder) — written ONLY via commit-record!, never
               mutated in place
    ledger   — an append-only audit trail of every proposal/verdict/
               disposition, regardless of outcome (commit or hold)")
